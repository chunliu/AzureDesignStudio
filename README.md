Azure Design Studio is a web application designed to simplify and streamline the process of creating solution architectures for Azure. With a focus on ease of use, efficiency, and consistency, it offers several key features:

- **Visual design**: Create solution architecture for Azure using a visually appealing and consistent styling.
- **Validation**: Ensure your design adheres to the rules and constraints of Azure resources to reduce errors.
- **Export**: Export your design as images for easy integration into your documents and presentations.
- **Cloud storage**: Save your design in the cloud for convenient access from any location.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) generation**: Automatically generate IaC for your design, with support for both ARM templates and Bicep.

The primary goal of Azure Design Studio is to help users create high-quality solution architectures for Azure while reducing the learning curve associated with ARM and Bicep. By improving the overall user experience, Azure Design Studio enables more efficient design and deployment of solutions on Azure.

As an award winning project, Azure Design Studio won the [3rd Place Winner award](https://www.credly.com/badges/08684d43-a00e-418c-8cf3-4b5eb48f601f/linked_in_profile) of **Microsoft Global Hackathon 2022**.
