Example: 0.01538 <br><br> -1 – indicates default price to be up-to on-demand. <br><br> You can set the maxPrice to -1 to indicate that the Azure Spot VM/VMSS should not be evicted for price reasons. Also, the default max price is -1 if it is not provided by you. <br><br>Minimum api-version: 2019-03-01.
